# Error Handling

## Overview

Forma uses two error classes in the schema/metadata pipeline.

## Write-path validation errors

Write operations wrap `forma.ErrInvalidInput` when the caller provides data that
cannot be accepted.

Examples:

- unknown write attribute names in `transformer.flattenToAttributes`
- invalid value conversion in `populateTypedValue`
- explicit `null` writes to schema-defined fields

These errors are intended to surface as user-facing `4xx` responses.

## Read-path consistency errors

Read operations return plain errors when persisted data and metadata disagree.

Examples:

- unknown attribute IDs encountered while rebuilding entities from EAV rows
- duplicate schema IDs or duplicate attribute IDs during metadata loading
- storage column mismatches such as a text attribute stored in `value_numeric`

These errors indicate metadata drift, corrupted state, or an incomplete
deployment, and should be treated as operator-visible consistency failures.

### `ErrParquetSetInconsistent`

`federated.ErrParquetSetInconsistent`, carried by
`federated.ParquetSetInconsistentError{SchemaID, MissingKeys}`, marks a
federated read whose manifest lists parquet objects that do not exist in
storage. The manifest is the authoritative record of the schema's cold/warm
tier, so a listed-but-absent object means that tier **has lost data** — the
rows in that object are simply gone from the result set.

- **Plain error, not `ErrInvalidInput`.** Nothing about the request is wrong;
  persisted data and the metadata indexing it disagree. It is an
  operator-visible consistency failure, not a user-facing `4xx`.
- **Not degradable.** It surfaces even under
  `federated.allow_partial_degraded_mode`, unlike the transient DuckDB/S3
  failures that fall back to Postgres-only. Degrading here would return
  exactly the silently short answer this classification exists to make loud.
- **Trigger precondition.** Only reachable when the server resolves parquet
  paths from the manifest source (`duckdb.manifestTemplate` configured — see
  `docs/federated-query/design.md` §4.3.1). With per-request path hints or
  glob-only reads the classification is skipped, and a missing object degrades
  to a shorter result set with no error.
- **Direction of the contract.** Only `manifest ⊆ live objects` is enforced.
  Extra unlisted objects are tolerated and invisible to reads.
- **Operator action.** The message names the schema and the missing
  bucket-relative keys. Run the reconciliation tool to diagnose and repair:
  see `docs/manifest-reconcile.md`.

## Message style

Use explicit messages that name:

- the logical value type
- the column or attribute that is wrong
- the expected state

Examples:

- `storage type mismatch for numeric: value_text should not be populated (expected value_numeric)`
- `unknown attribute id 999 for schema 402 (attribute not in metadata cache)`
- `attribute 'age' (attrID=2): invalid value: invalid input: cannot convert string to float64`
